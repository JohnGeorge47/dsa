### Grind

I absolutely suck at dsa or might I call it *leetcode* at this point
since the two words are synonymous at this point in the industry. So to alleviate
my imposter syndrome and in the process of trying to get hired at some big name place.I decided
to confront **leetcode** aka the devil.

So I decided to start the whole venture and I absolutely was terrible at it
Hell easy problems were hard. So I thought why not document the problems and who knows
maybe I might understand better (I wish)
